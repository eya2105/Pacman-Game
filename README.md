# Pacman-Game
This is a simple Pacman game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a player (Pacman) who moves around a maze, collects pellets, and avoids ghosts. It also includes power-ups that allow the player to scare the ghosts temporarily.

_**Features**_
Player (Pacman): The player can move up, down, left, and right to collect pellets and avoid ghosts.
Ghosts: The game features two ghosts that chase the player. When the player collects a power-up, the ghosts turn blue and become scared, allowing the player to eat them for points.
Pellets: The player collects small white pellets scattered throughout the maze to score points.
Power-ups: Special items that temporarily turn the ghosts blue, making them vulnerable.
Score: The score increases as the player collects pellets and eats ghosts.


_**How to Play**_
Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move the player (Pacman) around the maze.
Collect pellets for points.
Avoid the ghosts unless you've collected a power-up, which will turn the ghosts blue and allow you to eat them.
Your score will be displayed at the top of the screen.
